Networking Basics â€“ Detailed Notes
ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction to Networking & History
Origin of modern networking came from military needs (e.g., Cold War & ARPANET).

Satellite communications influenced early networking structures.

Foundation laid for the internet we use today.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Network Connections & ISPs
ISP (Internet Service Provider): Offers internet access to homes, offices.

Types of ISPs: Dial-up, Broadband, Fiber, LTE.

Public IP vs Private IP:

Public: Globally unique, assigned by ISP.

Private: Internal use in LAN (e.g., 192.168.x.x).

NAT (Network Address Translation): Converts private IPs to public.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Network Topologies
Bus Topology: Single cable backbone, all devices connected to it.

Star Topology: Central hub/switch connects all nodes.

Mesh Topology: Every device connected to every other â€” highly redundant.

Ring Topology: Data travels in one direction through each node.

Comparison:

Topology	Advantage	Disadvantage
Bus	Cheap	Single point of failure
Star	Easy to manage	Hub failure affects all
Mesh	Fault tolerant	Expensive
Ring	Predictable traffic	Failure in one breaks entire loop

ðŸ”¹ 4. IP Addressing & Subnetting
IPv4 Structure: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)

Classes:

Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255

Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255

Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

Subnetting: Dividing networks into smaller segments using subnet masks.

E.g., 255.255.255.0 (Class C default)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Ping, TTL, and Troubleshooting
ping [hostname/IP]: Checks connectivity.

TTL (Time To Live): Limits number of hops a packet can take.

Common tools:

ping: Test connection.

traceroute: Show hop-by-hop path.

netstat: Shows active connections.

ifconfig/ip a: Network interface details.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Router Functions & Routing Tables
Router: Forwards packets between networks using routing tables.

Static Routing: Manually configured.

Dynamic Routing: Automatically updates via protocols.

Routing Table Contains:

Destination network

Next hop IP

Interface

Metric (cost/preference)

ðŸ”¹ 7. Routing Protocols
ðŸ”¸ EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
Cisco proprietary.

Hybrid protocol (distance vector + link state).

Fast convergence, uses DUAL algorithm.

ðŸ”¸ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
Open standard.

Link-state protocol using cost (bandwidth-based metric).

Divides network into areas.

ðŸ”¸ BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
Used for routing between ISPs.

Path vector protocol.

Each ISP is an Autonomous System (AS).

BGP ensures internet-wide routing efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ 8. EtherChannel & STP
EtherChannel: Combines multiple Ethernet links into one logical link to increase bandwidth.

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):

Prevents loops in Layer 2 networks.

Elects a root bridge.

Blocks redundant paths until needed.

ðŸ”¹ 9. MPLS & VPNs
ðŸ”¸ MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
High-performance method of forwarding packets using labels rather than IPs.

Faster and efficient for enterprise networks.

ðŸ”¸ VPN (Virtual Private Network)
Secure, encrypted tunnel over the internet.

Types:

Remote Access VPN

Site-to-Site VPN

SSL VPN

IPSec VPN
