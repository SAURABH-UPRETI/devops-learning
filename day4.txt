Linux User Management, Sudo, Switching Users & Process Monitoring
👤 User Management
adduser saurabh – Adds a new user with home directory

userdel saurabh – Deletes a user

passwd saurabh – Set/change password for user

id saurabh – Displays UID, GID, and groups of the user

groups saurabh – Shows group membership

🔒 Sudo (Superuser Do)
Allows a normal user to execute commands as root/admin

sudo <command> – Run command with superuser privileges

Users need to be in the sudo group (check via: groups saurabh)

Edit sudoers: sudo visudo (use cautiously)

🔁 Switching Users
su - <username> – Switch to another user (requires their password)

exit – Return to previous user

whoami – Shows current logged-in user

sudo -i – Switch to root with root environment

🧠 Important Concepts
Root is the most powerful user.

Avoid logging in as root directly; use sudo for safety.

Use different users for different roles for security.

⚙️ Process Monitoring Commands
ps aux – Shows all running processes

ps -ef – Another format to view running processes

top – Interactive real-time view of system processes

htop – Advanced version of top (may require install)

kill <PID> – Terminate a process

kill -9 <PID> – Forcefully kill a stuck process

✅ Day 4: Basic Networking Commands in Linux
🌐 ping
Test connectivity between systems

ping google.com – Sends ICMP echo request to check connection

Use Ctrl + C to stop continuous ping

🌍 traceroute
Shows path that a packet takes to reach the destination

traceroute google.com

Helps in identifying network latency and hops

(Use sudo apt install traceroute if not installed)

🔄 netstat (deprecated but still used)
Displays network connections, routing tables, ports

netstat -tuln – Shows listening TCP/UDP ports

netstat -anp – Shows all connections with process ID

Replacement: ss command

ss -tuln – Faster alternative to netstat

🔧 ifconfig (deprecated; replaced by ip command)
Shows and configures network interfaces

ifconfig – Lists all interfaces and their IPs

ifconfig eth0 down/up – Disable/enable an interface

✅ ip command (modern alternative to ifconfig)
ip a – Show IP addresses and interfaces

ip link – Show interface status

ip route – Show routing table
